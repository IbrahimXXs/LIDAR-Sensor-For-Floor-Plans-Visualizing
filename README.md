# LIDAR-Sensor-For-Floor-Plans-Visualizing

## Overview

### *Lidar, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth.*
### *In this Project, The LIDAR concept is used to sense obstacles, and the project provides functionalities for path planning algorithms.*

#### Features

* Simulated LIDAR sensor for obstacle sensing.
  
* Pygame-based graphical environment for visualization.
  
* Path planning algorithms for generating and visualizing paths.

#### Requirements

* Python 3.x

* Pygame library

* NumPy Library

#### Usage

Navigate to the project directory:

1- Open command prompt

2- cd pygame-path-lidar-sim

3- Run the main script:

This will launch the Pygame environment with the simulated LIDAR.

*Note: Feel free to use custom Floor Plans, But the file should be as the following: 1200x600 - PNG - White Background*
